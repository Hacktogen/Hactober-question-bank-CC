# Contribution Guide

## How To Contribute
It's really simple, fork this repository and write the code for any problem from any folder of your preferred difficulty level. Check the solution by submitting the solution on the respective online judge, if the verdict is AC(Answer Correct), then add a single file with the code in the respective problem folder.


## Programming Language
These problems are from some of the really famous online judges hence they support almost all the programming languages, still it is recommended that you write your code in any one of the programming languages :-
1. C 5.3.0 - GNU C Compiler
2. C++ 5.3.0 - GNU C++ Compiler

4. JAVA 1.8.0 - OpenJDK Java
5. PYTH3 3.x - Python 3


## Note
1. Please submit a single file of any programming language containing the solution code.

2. While making a PR please include following things in the description section-
    - Space Complexity of your solution
    - Time Complexity of your solution

3. Only first 10 PR with AC verdict will be added for a particular question, so please don't make a PR if you see 5 solutions are already added in that particular question folder.

4. You can only make a single PR for a particular questions, i.e. multiple solutions of the same problem by the same user will not be allowed

5. PLease refrain from stealing solutions from the internet, there is no point of cheating as that will debar you from real learning. **Remember that the imposter always loses** ðŸ˜„
